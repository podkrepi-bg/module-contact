## Development
The module is configured to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)'s [Remote Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
 - Make sure you have the extension installed
 - Open the folder of the module in VS Code
 - Hit `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Shift` + `P` -> Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container

Linting:
```bash
task lint
```

Building:
```bash
task build
```

Watch task that will re-build and run the module as the Go files are modified:
```bash
task watch
```

Testing:
```bash
task test
```

## Deployment
To deploy the module you first need to make sure there is a schema called `contact` created. Preferrably create a user that has access only to this schema. You can do that with the following script:
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA contact;
CREATE USER module_contact WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secretpass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON SCHEMA contact TO module_contact;
```

You can then deploy with the Kubernetes manifests located in the `manifests` folder in this repo.
